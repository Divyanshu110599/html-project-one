        The estimated cost of the property refers to the value of the entire property, including the physical structure
        of the home as well as the value of the land the home sits on. <br>

        The building value, however, refers to the value of the structure of the building on that land. This can be
        thought of as the amount <br> your home would need to be insured for or the cost to rebuild the physical structure of
        your home without the land. Please note, this does not include damage to internal content such as refrigerators
        or washing machines.</p>
